How-ever, few researches employ graph convolutional network for text classification, especially for short text classification. In this work, a special text graph of the short-text corpus is created, and then a short-text graph convolutional network (STGCN) is developed. Specifical-ly, different topic models for short text are employed, and a short tex-t short-text graph based on the word co-occurrence, document word relations, and text topic information, is developed. The word and sen-tence representations generated by the STGCN are considered as the classification feature. In addition, a pre-trained word vector obtained by the BERTs hidden layer is employed, which greatly improves the classification effect of our model. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple short text datasets.","tags":["Text Classification"],"title":"Document and Word Representations Generated by Graph Convolutional Network and BERT for Short Text Classification","type":"publication"}]
